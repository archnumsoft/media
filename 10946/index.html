  <h1>A Fully Coupled Immersed Finite Element Method for Fluid Structure Interaction via the Deal.II Library</h1>
  <h2>Luca Heltai, Saswati Roy, Francesco Costanzo</h2>
  
<p>We present the implementation of a solution scheme for fluid-structure
interaction problems via the finite element software library
deal.II. The solution scheme is an immersed finite element method in
which two independent discretizations are used for the fluid and
immersed deformable body.  In this type of formulation the support of
the equations of motion of the fluid is extended to cover the union of
the solid and fluid domains.  The equations of motion over the
extended solution domain govern the flow of a fluid under the action
of a body force field.  This body force field informs the fluid of the
presence of the immersed solid.  The velocity field of the immersed
solid is the restriction over the immersed domain of the velocity
field in the extended equations of motion.  The focus of this paper is
to show how the determination of the motion of the immersed domain is
carried out in practice.  We show that our implementation is general,
that is, it is not dependent on a specific choice of the finite
element spaces over the immersed solid and the extended fluid domains.
We present some preliminary results concerning the accuracy of the
proposed method.</p>
