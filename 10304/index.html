    <h1>A Framework for the Implementation of Coupled Multiphase Flow Problems Using the deal.II Library and Its Application to Electrowetting</h1>
    <h2>Abner J. Salgado</h2>
    
    The purpose of this work is to introduce some ideas aimed at
    simplifying the implementation of schemes for the solution of
    multiphysics and multidomain problems and describe their realization
    in the \dealII library.  Namely, we introduce a general interface to
    describe problems and how different sub-problems might depend on each
    other. We illustrate the applicability of these concepts on the
    discretization of the phenomenon known as electrowetting.
